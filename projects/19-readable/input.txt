In this course we will use the Kotlin programming language.

In my experience, students develop a style of programming in their
first programming language. They find it difficult to learn a
different style later, even if they switch to a different
language. This means that students should start early to use a modern
language that encourages writing clean and elegant code, and supports
a good object-oriented and functional style.

We will therefore use Kotlin in this course. Kotlin is fully
compatible with Java, so you can use it for anything that can be done
in Java, but it is a much more modern, much more readable, and much
more sensible language. We will also experiment with compiling Kotlin
source to Javascript, so you can run your programs inside a web
browser, and will even write small apps that can run on Android
phones.

Most students will still have to learn C++ and/or Java later during
their studiesâ€”but I believe that after getting programming practice in
Kotlin, they will be able to write better code in those languages as
well.
