# CS109 Kotlin tutorial

This repository contains example code for my Kotlin tutorial at
http://otfried.org/courses/cs109/tutorial.html.

Also included are:

* modules to unify drawing graphics using Java.AWT, the HTML5 Canvas
  (in Javascript), and on Android.

* A module that allows students to build simple programs with a
  graphical user interface without learning about Swing or event-based
  programming.

  See http://otfried.org/courses/cs109/tutorial_cs109ui.html for
  documentation.

* A framework to allow students to develop simple Android apps (called
  "mini-apps") without using the Android SDK, including a simple
  emulator.
