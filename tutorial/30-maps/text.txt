When I started programming, there were no graphical displays. 
All computer input and output was done using text.

A computer was shared by many users.  Each user was connected to the
computer from a terminal (which is called this way because it is
the endpoint of the connection from the computer to the user).

The earliest terminals looked like a combination of a printer with a
keyboard.  (When I was in middle school, I was sometimes allowed to
play with a computer that used such a printing terminal.)

The printers were later replaced by CRT displays that could typically
display a matrix of 25x80 characters (the ASCII alphabet with letters,
digits, and some special graphical characters).

Users interacted with the computer by typing a command on the
keyboard.  The computer responded by printing the output of the
command on the terminal.
